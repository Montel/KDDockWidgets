/**
 * @brief The LayoutMemory struct contains a simplified layout of a MultiSplitter.
 *
 * By layout, what is meant is the list of all widgets in the MultiSplitter and their relations
 * (neighbours to the left/right/top/bottom).
 *
 * MultiSplitter already stores its own layout, via the list of Anchor instances. LayoutMemory
 * effectively is a secondary layout, which duplicates the same information, but with two differences:
 * 1. LayoutMemory keeps the dock widgets in the layout even when they are closed, hidden or floating.
 *    This way MultiSplitter can query LayoutMemory to ask where to restore a widget to. This is the
 *    whole point of LayoutMemory, and also why it's called 'Memory'. It remembers.
 *
 * 2. LayoutMemory is very minimal and doesn't store any sizing or position information. It only
 *    has relations, so you can know which widgets are at the left of another widget, etc.
 *
 * This design keeps the MultiSplitter code sane. We could easily add some type of placeholders to
 * the MultiSplitter, so it could remember. But that would increase the code complexity an order of
 * magnitute. This way, each class does a single thing and does it right.
